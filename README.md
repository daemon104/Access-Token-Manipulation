# Access-Token-Manipulation

Access Token Manipulation is a technique commonly use in privilege escalation. This program will use ATM technique to create a new process with a stolen token from other process. The target process is a high-level process running by system so that the program will take it's token, duplicate it then create process with that duplicated token to call cmd.exe as system (NT-Authority-System) user. Detail steps:

* First, set SeDubugPrivilege for current process with AdjustTokenPrivileges(). This privilege is needed
* Next, get handle of target process and then use it to get the token handle with OpenProcessToken(). The target process must be a high-level (system process) process to make the technique works
* Then, duplicate the token with DuplicateTokenEx(), now we got a token of NT-Authority-System
* Finnally, create new process with duplicated token using CreatProcessWithToken() to call cmd.exe as system. 

After run the program, we will get a cmd.exe of user NT-Authority-System, privilege escalation phase done.

Usage:
```ATM.exe <process's name>```

Example:
```ATM.exe winlogon.exe```
